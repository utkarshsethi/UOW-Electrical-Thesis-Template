   title = {Intrusion Detection System to Advance Internet of Things Infrastructure-Based Deep Learning Algorithms},
   journal = {Complexity},
   volume = {2021},
   pages = {5579851},
   abstract = {Smart grids, advanced information technology, have become the favored intrusion targets due to the Internet of Things (IoT) using sensor devices to collect data from a smart grid environment. These data are sent to the cloud, which is a huge network of super servers that provides different services to different smart infrastructures, such as smart homes and smart buildings. These can provide a large space for attackers to launch destructive cyberattacks. The novelty of this proposed research is the development of a robust framework system for detecting intrusions based on the IoT environment. An IoTID20 dataset attack was employed to develop the proposed system; it is a newly generated dataset from the IoT infrastructure. In this framework, three advanced deep learning algorithms were applied to classify the intrusion: a convolution neural network (CNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM), and a hybrid convolution neural network with the long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) model. The complexity of the network dataset was dimensionality reduced, and to improve the proposed system, the particle swarm optimization method (PSO) was used to select relevant features from the network dataset. The obtained features were processed using deep learning algorithms. The experimental results showed that the proposed systems achieved accuracy as follows: CNN&#x2009;&#x3d;&#x2009;96.60&#x0025;, LSTM&#x2009;&#x3d;&#x2009;99.82&#x0025;, and CNN-LSTM&#x2009;&#x3d;&#x2009;98.80&#x0025;. The proposed framework attained the desired performance on a new variable dataset, and the system will be implemented in our university IoT environment. The results of comparative predictions between the proposed framework and existing systems showed that the proposed system more efficiently and effectively enhanced the security of the IoT environment from attacks. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed framework based on deep learning algorithms for an intrusion detection system can effectively detect real-world attacks and is capable of enhancing the security of the IoT environment.},

   journal = {Applied Soft Computing},
   volume = {68},
   pages = {910-922},
   abstract = {Recently, there have been great advances in internet of things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) leading to the fourth industrial revolution in power grid, namely, Smart Grid Industry 4.0 (SGI 4.0). In the Smart Grid Industry 4.0 framework, the WSNs have the potential to improve power grid efficiency by cable replacement, deployment flexibility, and cost reduction. However, the smart grid (SG) environment that the WSNs operate in is very challenging because of equipment noise, dust, heat, electromagnetic interference, multipath effects and fading, which make it difficult for current WSNs to provide reliable communication. For SGI 4.0 to come true, a WSN-based highly reliable communication infrastructure is essential for successful operation of the next-generation electricity power grids. To address this need, in this paper a novel dynamic clustering based energy efficient and quality-of-service (QoS)-aware routing protocol (called EQRP), which is inspired by the real behavior of the bird mating optimization (BMO), has been proposed. The proposed distributed scheme improves network reliability significantly and reduces excessive packets retransmissions for WSN-based SG applications. Performance results show that the proposed protocol has successfully reduced the end-to-end delay and has improved packet delivery ratio, memory utilization, residual energy, and throughput.},

   abstract = {The low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies, which is now embracing a booming era with the development in the Internet of Things (IoT), may offer a brand new solution for current smart grid communications due to their excellent features of low power, long range, and high capacity. The mission-critical smart grid communications require secure and reliable connections between the utilities and the devices with high quality of service (QoS). This is difficult to achieve for unlicensed LPWAN technologies due to the crowded license free band. Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), as a licensed LPWAN technology, is developed based on the existing long-term evolution specifications and facilities. Thus, it is able to provide cellular-level QoS, and henceforth can be viewed as a promising candidate for smart grid communications. In this paper, we introduce NB-IoT to the smart grid and compare it with the existing representative communication technologies in the context of smart grid communications in terms of data rate, latency, range, etc. The overall requirements of communications in the smart grid from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives are comprehensively investigated and each of them is carefully examined for NB-IoT. We further explore the representative applications in the smart grid and analyze the corresponding feasibility of NB-IoT. Moreover, the performance of NB-IoT in typical scenarios of the smart grid communication environments, such as urban and rural areas, is carefully evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations.},

   abstract = {Currently, many researchers worldwide are focusing on creating a novel service model by integrating IoT (Internet of Things) technologies with ICT (Information and Communications Technologies) to increase energy efficiency by reducing power consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper examines the problems related to the current integrated ESS (Energy Storage System) in a smart grid: high installation costs and low management efficiency. To solve these problems, this paper studies the development of a micro-distributed ESS in an intelligent LED (Light Emitting Diode) streetlight system, and its low-cost installation and high management efficiency in a micro grid. Through the application of this system, the initial installation costs can be reduced by using micro-distributed ESS and IoT-based intelligent energy management, facilitating power monitoring of the streetlights and energy efficient demand resource management in the micro grid. This provides a more intelligent and efficient environment, such as in a smart-city.},

   abstract = {With the significant improvement in deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) into the smart grid infrastructure, the demand for cyber security is rapidly growing. The Energy Internet (EI) also known as the integrated internet-based smart grid and energy resources inherits all the security vulnerabilities of the existing smart grid. The security structure of the smart grid has become inadequate in meeting the security needs of energy domains in the 21st century. In this paper, we propose a cyber security framework capable of providing adequate security and privacy, and supporting efficient energy management in the EI. The proposed framework uses an identity-based security mechanism (I-ICAAAN), a secure communication protocol and an Intelligent Security System for Energy Management (ISSEM) to certify security and privacy in the EI. Nash Equilibrium solution of game theory is applied for the evaluation of our proposed ISSEM based on security events allocation. The formal verification and theoretical analysis show that our proposed framework provides security and privacy improvement for IoT-based EI.},

   abstract = {Energy is vital parameter for communication in Internet of Things (IoT) applications via Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Genetic algorithms with dynamic clustering approach are supposed to be very effective technique in conserving energy during the process of network planning and designing for IoT. Dynamic clustering recognizes the cluster head (CH) with higher energy for the data transmission in the network. In this paper, various applications, like smart transportation, smart grid, and smart cities, are discussed to establish that implementation of dynamic clustering computing-based IoT can support real-world applications in an efficient way. In the proposed approach, the dynamic clustering-based methodology and frame relay nodes (RN) are improved to elect the most preferred sensor node (SN) amidst the nodes in cluster. For this purpose, a Genetic Analysis approach is used. The simulations demonstrate that the proposed technique overcomes the dynamic clustering relay node (DCRN) clustering algorithm in terms of slot utilization, throughput and standard deviation in data transmission.},

Smart Grids (SGs) stand out among the many applications of IoT and comprise several embedded intelligent technologies to improve the reliability and the safety of power grids. SGs use communication protocols for information exchange, such as the Open Smart Grid Protocol (OSGP). However, OSGP does not support the integration with devices compliant with the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), a communication protocol used in conventional IoT systems. In this sense, this article presents an efficient software interface that provides integration between OSGP and CoAP.

   journal = {Environmental Impact Assessment Review},
   volume = {88},

   abstract = {Nowadays, the concept of smart cities evolves from conceptual models to various stages of development. The smart services of cities like smart buildings, smart hospitals, smart traffic, smart factories, and smart transportation are vital to energizing resilient, reliable, seamless energy and electrical flow. One of these smart services' critical challenges is anticipated to run without disruptions using smart energy and smart electrical grids. Hence, in this research, the Internet of Things (IoT) role in green energy resources incorporation into smart electrical grids has been introduced using the Multi-Objective Distributed Dispatching algorithm (MODDA). Efficient energy management includes a tradeoff between the cost linked with utility function and energy consumption. The utility function can be the living comfort of the consumers or the utility firm's gross income. The interchanges between utility and energy consumption must, therefore, be recognized. The algorithm is intended to transmit the renewable green energy available to the battery, thermal, and load storing while preserving a thermal and battery storage limit. The experimental results at the lab-scale show the proposed dispatching algorithm minimizing the system cost and energy consumption. It is shown that substantial energy waste can be reduced by equipping a smart building with the proposed IoT system for effective green energy management.},

This article will focus not only on three smart grid applications, but also the outcome of this research which is relevant to a wider range of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Different combinations of off-the-shelf wired and wireless last-mile communication technologies are evaluated using real-world transport protocols such as the Transport Control Protocol (TCP)and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The performance of TCP/UDP has been tested in a realistic client-server communication test-bed. The results from extensive evaluations show that typical latency values are between 200 and 600Â ms for data packets and 50Â bytes and Â kbytes for short control packets. Moreover by applying data compression techniques ,the results can be improved about 5%?20% for different last mile communications.},
